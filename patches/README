These patches can be applied on a linux kernel.

The first patch can only be used if the kernel-source is maintained in a
git repository. If the patch is applied 'make deb-pkg' also generates a
'debian source package'.

The second patch is needed if 'grub' should be used. The patch adds some
runtime dependencies. The additional tools are needed by grub to generate
a correct grub-menu entry for the kernel.
