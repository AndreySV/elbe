ELBE
====

http://elbe-rfs.org

ELBE is the 'E.mbedded L.inux B.uild E.nvironment'.
It can be used to build embedded Linux Rootfilesystems.

ELBE runs on Debian Linux Host Systems.

Crash Course
------------
1. use a Elbe XML file (e.g. from /usr/share/doc/elbe/examples or
   examples/ in the elbe source tree)

2. run "./elbe init ./examples/beaglebone-black.xml".
   This command creates the build directory in the current working directory.

3. go into the working directory "cd build", run "make" and wait.

4. copy the rfs to a sdcard: 'sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0'

5. run 'make run-con' to boot the ELBE Buildenvironment in qemu/kvm.
   (login: root password: root)

6. Use 'elbe chroot /var/cache/elbe/build' to enter the Beaglebone Black
   Build Environment.

For more documentation run 'make' at the docs folder.
An introduction can be found in docs/elbeoverview-en.html
Also man pages will be build.
