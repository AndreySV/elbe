ELBE
====

http://elbe-rfs.org

ELBE is the 'E.mbedded L.inux B.uild E.nvironment'.
It can be used to build embedded Linux Rootfilesystems.

ELBE runs on Debian Linux Host Systems.

Crash Course
------------
1. use a Elbe XML file (e.g. from /usr/share/doc/elbe/examples or
   examples/ in the elbe source tree)

2. run "./elbe create ./examples/i386-example.xml".
   This command creates the build directory in the current working directory.

3. go into the working directory "cd build", run "make" and wait.

4. run 'make run-con' to boot the ELBE Buildenvironment in qemu/kvm.
   A stripped down and readonly target rootfilesystem is available within
     'nfsroot.tar.gz'

Report bugs or any other feedback
---------------------------------
There is no bugtracking system at the moment.
Please report bugs or success stories to <elbe-devel@linutronix.de>.

Development
-----------
There is a 'TODO' file that describes the next development steps.
The project is hosted on github: https://github.com/linutronix/elbe
If you are intrested in joining the elbe-devel team please send an email to
<elbe-devel@linutronix.de>.

Port it to other systems
------------------------
It is possible to port it to other systems, but it has a dependency to
python-apt. So either this dependency needs to be eliminated, or python-apt
needs to be available on the target platform.
