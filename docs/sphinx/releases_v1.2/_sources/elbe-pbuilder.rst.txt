NAME
====

elbe-pbuilder - High Level Interface to the ELBE Package Build System.
Allows to create a package builder for a project and to build Debian
packages.

SYNOPSIS
========

    ::

        elbe pbuilder build [--project <project> | --xmlfile <xmlfile>]
        elbe pbuilder create --project <project>

DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a pbuilder for a specified project and builds the Debian package
like pbuilder, but for the configured ELBE project.

OPTIONS
=======

--project <dir>
    *key* (/var/cache/elbe/<uuid> for the project inside the initvm to
    use. Use *elbe control list\_projects* to get a list of the
    available projects.

--xmlfile <xmlfile>
    This file is used to create a new ELBE project including the
    pbuilder environment.

COMMANDS
========

*build*
    Build the *Debianized Project* in the current working directory. (A
    valid ./debian directory needs to exist.) If --project was
    specified, the specified build environment will be used. If
    --xmlfile is specified a new build environment will be created for
    the given ELBE XML File and the *Debianized Project* in the current
    working directory will be build. The result of the package build is
    stored in ../ like pbuilder does.

*create*
    A pbuilder environment for the given project will be created.
