elbe-pbuilder - High Level Interface to the ELBE Package Build System.
              Allows to create a package builder for a project and to build
              Debian packages.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'elbe pbuilder' 'build' [--project <project> | --xmlfile <xmlfile>]
'elbe pbuilder' 'create' --project <project>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Creates a pbuilder for a specified project and builds the Debian package
like pbuilder, but for the configured ELBE project.

OPTIONS
-------

--project <dir>::
	'key' (/var/cache/elbe/<uuid> for the project inside the initvm to use.
	Use 'elbe control list_projects' to get a list of the available projects.

--xmlfile <xmlfile>::
	This file is used to create a new ELBE project including the pbuilder
	environment.

COMMANDS
--------

'build'::

Build the 'Debianized Project' in the current working directory. (A valid
./debian directory needs to exist.) If --project was specified, the specified
build environment will be used. If --xmlfile is specified a new build
environment will be created for the given ELBE XML File and the 'Debianized
Project' in the current working directory will be build. The result of the
package build is stored in ../ like pbuilder does.

'create'::

A pbuilder environment for the given project will be created.
