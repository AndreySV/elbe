 subcommands need to be executed with root privileges. It is not recommended to
 install this package on a native system.

 'elbe gen_update' command from the 'elbe-buildenv' package) is placed in this
 directory the update will be applied.
 Downgrades are possible by the integrated SOAP interface.
