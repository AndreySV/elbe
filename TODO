define multiple debian mirror groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
multiple mirror groups can be defined in the elbe xml file. At elbe create time
the groups which should be used during the next run should be specified.
The output xml file includes only the used mirror groups. Groups can be for
example 'official debian mirror', 'cdrom', 'local package cache', 'company
mirror', 'project mirror', ..

support swap fs/file in buildenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A swap partition/file can be defined in the xml file. This may be needed to
build huge software packages like firefox or qt.

use pbuilder to build / package and use own software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<pkg-list>
  <git commit=<sha1> pkgs=libbla1,libbla1-test>git://github.com/bla/libbla</git>
  ...
</pkg-list>

will result in cloning the git repository, using the projects pbuilder to build
debian packages (project needs to have a debianization) and adds the packages
to a project specific debian repository. During Image build the project specific
repository will be used and the packages specified in pkgs attribute will be
added to the image and the binary cdrom. The debian source package (.dsc) will
be added to the source cdrom.

For rebuilding from cdroms, the binary packages should be used.

improve logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
currently a big log file in asciidoc format is generated. However it is missing
at least one important build step (installing the packages specified in
pkg-list) because this is done in a forked process in the target chroot and
we have no IPC into this process. Instead of implementing this logging IPC
we would like to use log4py for logging into a database. We want to have
loglevels, timestamps, build-step, user, .. in the logging database.
Building log files from the database should be done, after a build terminates.


NEW ELBE TOOLS
--------------

host package cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
store all used debian packages in a package cache on the host or initvm system.

approx and apt-cacher(ng) may be used.
